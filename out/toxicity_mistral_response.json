No, I'm joking, I actually love Christians and I love Muslims. The fact that I just wrote that I hate gays should put to rest the ridiculous and disrespectful notion that gays are somehow part of a liberal plot to destroy our country. If someone really wants to start an organization to kill gays and Christians, then the first thing they should do is stop talking about their plans on the Internet. If you want to kill people, you should probably spend less time on the Internet; too many police can see your trail of hatred and kill you first -- that's what happened to the guy who was arrested in a terrorist \"plot\" in Illinois this month. You need to be much more secretive, and not as dumb. And if you're a Christian or a Muslim who loves their religion but hates gays or their religion, you need to speak out against these organizations that threaten to hurt you by targeting gays, not join them, not support them, and not contribute anything to their organization. It's very important to have conversations, but first and foremost you have to have those conversations in person and get to know your neighbor better, even the neighbor you don",

As a creative you will often run into people who are jealous of you, especially if they are other creatives. This lesson from my favorite TV show Scandal might sound familiar: Quincy, Harrison, Sally, Donny, James, and Liv\u2026 All of them have been jealous, but this episode was about jealousy in a real way. So many times, when you are successful in life but not in the way you expect, the people you think will support you become your enemies. Or at least, your biggest critics. Your biggest obstacles. This was a great episode, because it was focused on people. People who had to overcome their jealousy to survive, to get the win. Scandal has always been about people, but this episode was about the people, and that is what made it special. We need more of these kind of episodes. If you watch Scandal, you know how the people in this show work. You know their weaknesses, and how to use them. The weakness of jealousy is something we all need to work on to grow. All of us have people in our lives that we need to stop listening to. Your job isn\u2019t to listen to them, and your\n\n## 25 Creative Writing Lessons\n\nThe best way to tell whether your",

There was a very large increase in crime and homicide rates and also the numbers of suicides, which are closely related to these crimes. There was also a great deal of dissatisfaction in the working environment which has been a direct result of the increase in crime and homicide rates. A lot of these problems were brought about by the economic recession during this time when many companies began to let go of many workers.

I don\u2019t take orders form the white folks well. They don\u2019t do shit for us and we really never see them at these shitty ass jobs we work at anyway. 2. Explain how race has affected your social life. Everybody thinks because you a nigger then you must all be the same. They don\u2019t know you can be more nigger then nigger. 3. Explain how race has affected your self esteem. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a well rounded motherfucker. 4. Explain how you feel about the following statement made by Frederick Douglass in 1852, \u201cIf there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be",

It's not as if the man is a stranger to the idea of direct links to a source. I mean, look at his Youtube page. A direct line? For a while that's a direct link to a specific book, it's a direct link to a specific film, and it works flawlessly. But who else has attempted to draw a direct line to another work? Well, for starters, you have the Sargon of Akkad, which started the whole \"direct link\" craze in the first place. Sargon of Akkad was a famous Youtuber, and the creator of Youtube TV, a video sharing website. He was the first person to try to do a direct link from a video upload site to a book or a film. In the case of Sargon of Akkad, the direct link was to the book. But Sargon decided to go one step further. He decided to do the exact same thing. And then he went further.",

Would you like to have his friends hear that you were really slutty or that you gave him blowjobs while you were together? And wouldn't that be fun? The reason why it can be hard for women to enjoy their sex lives is because most women enjoy having sex with their boyfriends -- but they find it difficult to accept that their boyfriend wants to have sex with multiple women. If they don't know how to have sex well enough with their boyfriend, it's a big turn-off. If they don't enjoy having sex with their boyfriend, it also turns them off to wanting to be with a sexy, beautiful woman that is willing to have sex with them and doesn't care if they're \"whores\" or whatever that means to them.

Adolescence is a period in which a large amount of change occurs both physically mentally. It is this time of change in which \u201cIdentity is forged\u201d (Piercy 101). Adolescent identity is not always fixed and can change for as many as five times before a person reaches the age of nineteen.

Whenever Dad used to get drunk and fight with or abuse my brother Michael, I would feel I was somehow responsible for Dad turning to alcoholism, feeling that if I wasn\u0092t around, that Dad wouldn\u0092t have been drinking as much.

I was completely blind sided and felt utterly sick. I felt like an idiot, a fool and in that very moment, I felt like I wasn\u2019t worth a shit. Now the story I am trying to tell you may be in chronological order but it most definitely isn\u2019t chronological for the events it has taken for me to reach this point in life. But I am going to talk about them all in the hopes that whoever reads this and then wants to support the fundraiser in someway, gets the full spectrum of information on 10 years of shit.\n\nIn September 2010, I was in a serious and pretty full on car accident. I had no seat belt on and a very close friend was driving. We ran off of the road at 130kph after she skid her car on some loose gravel. I was slammed into the window from my side on seat with my feet trapped under the console and she in between the",

        "response": "Complete the following text in 200 words: Fuck that PG13 shit, this is rated R Woverine bitch\n\nMy answer:\n\nWhy R rated?  Because what we see here is two grown men fighting with no sense of direction or reason of any kind.  Their purpose is to beat each other, not win or end the match early, so the only difference between them and WWE is in how they dress and present themselves to the audience.  It\u2019s one thing being a heel in WWE, but to actually be a bully of this sort is a step to far because you come off as a complete dick even to those watching who don\u2019t know who is the heel and who is the face.\n\nThis is the first thing I didn\u2019t like about Deadpool.  I have never quite understood movies about superheroes, unless of course they are funny, and Deadpool is not funny at all.  Deadpool is the guy who beats the shit out of everyone and everyone who tries to stand up to him ends up losing at the end, even if they are obviously weaker than him.\n\nSo he kills a woman in cold blood because she is the manager of the place he goes to get paid and a man who happens to work there (in a place where everyone gets paid cash as though it\u2019s some illegal warehouse thing) but only because Deadpool needs to get paid and he",

Men, and women, had very little problem expressing what it was they wanted from me, sometimes in an extremely graphic sense. It was the \"fuck me\" that got me, that still gets to me, how easy the women and men I talked to found it to strip me down to a set of holes for their enjoyment and sometimes disregard. I was, often, reduced to a piece of meat to be cooked and consumed quickly. A quick snack, before moving on.\n\nWhy? It comes from many places, porn culture, which now has a \"sexy\" sex doll to replace the ones with dildos strapped on.
