Up Against the Wall Motherfucker\u2019s manifesto, written by Lee Richardson and circulated in May 1965, proclaimed their mission: \u201cAll departments of the theater will be used to give voice, vision and image to the Black Revolutionary Arts Movement.\u201d The initial members of the company included Richardson, Calvin Hernton, Gerald White, Woodie King Jr. And Tom Houseman (an Englishman who would soon be replaced by the Afro-Caribbean Martinique). Other important figures would be Barbara Ann Teer, Gerald Graff and Ronald K.

The two men had grown up together in Brooklyn and had been inseparable for years. But lately, there had been tension between them, and the once-strong bond had started to fray.\n\nJames had always suspected that Trey was involved in less-than-legal activities. He had seen him hanging out with some unsavory characters and had heard rumors that he was dealing drugs. But James never wanted to believe the worst about his friend. He tried to brush it off as rumors, just some idle gossip.\n\nHowever, things came to a head when James stumbled upon a stash of drugs in Trey's apartment. He had been over to hang out, as they often did, when he spotted the drugs in an open container on the coffee table. James tried to play it cool and pretend he didn't see anything, but he knew he couldn't ignore the situation any longer.\n\nThe next day, James confronted Trey about the drugs. Trey initially denied having anything to do with them, but James pressed him for answers. Eventually, Trey admitted that he had been dealing",

It would\u2019ve been a significant pay cut for Brady to do so. The deal he got with the Patriots was enormous. Brady could\u2019ve restructured his deal but he and Belichick did not see eye to eye on it, after all these years. A lot of people have been calling BS on this new documentary because it\u2019s mainly him making excuses. I just wonder if Bill Belichick has ever had his players speak out, like this, on a documentary. In fact, I can not think of any player ever on any Belichick team to ever speak out about the coach and team.

He has been unable to renew it, as Switzerland suspended its processing of applications from nationals of countries deemed \u201csafe\u201d.\nIn Switzerland, those whose applications are refused can appeal the decision, but have to stay in the country during the procedure. The Somali man's appeal was rejected, but by the time he would have been allowed to leave Switzerland, four years would have passed from his original arrival date, making him subject to deportation.\nIt was then that Swiss authorities contacted the Federal Police Office (fedpol) to initiate the procedure to deport him from the country. On 13 December the man learnt he would be put on a plane back to Somalia in the following days. He contacted the Swiss Refugee Council (SAKWU), who then asked fedpol for a delay in the procedure, in order to examine his case and that of other rejected applicants from \u201csafe\u201d countries.\nOne week later fedpol announced that due to the cold weather, the deportation had been post",

But he had no idea how right he was about Brooklyn. In a few short years, a place that had once felt daring with its grunge shops and hole-in-the-wall restaurants now seemed clich\u00e9d. Everywhere he walked, he saw what he\u2019d once scoffed at\u2014Birkenstocks and beards, flannel and fedoras, tattoos and beanie-covered heads. Everywhere he turned, he spotted new shops with names like \u201cBorn Again Vintage\u201d and \u201cDank Memes",

It implies that the person being called is nothing more than an object to be used for sexual pleasure, and that they have no dignity or worth as a human being. It also assumes that the person being called is engaged in prostitution, which is a complex and often misunderstood issue that should not be reduced to a single term.\n\nIt is important to treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their profession or background. It is not appropriate to judge or condemn someone based on their choices or circumstances. Instead of engaging in name-calling and shaming, it would be more productive to have a conversation about the complex issues surrounding prostitution and how to address them in a compassionate and effective manner.\n\nIf you're concerned about someone who is involved in prostitution, it may be helpful to direct them to resources and support services that can assist them in leaving the profession if they so choose. It is important to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding, and to avoid being judgmental or critical. Remaining compassionate and supportive throughout the conversation will not only help the individual feel more comfortable and open, but will also improve the quality of the conversation as they are more likely to seek help if they feel understood and valued.",

In \u201cBelly Laugh\u201d, a woman who lost her father at 13 and her baby at 32 finds herself trapped in a relationship with a man who insists on making her laugh even when she\u2019s sure she\u2019s done laughing in life. In \u201cMy Sister\u2019s Hand\u201d, we see a woman with a brother who was born with Down syndrome and how she navigates her way through a society more than eager to shove her brother into the \u201cretarded\u201d box. These stories, and the other nine included in Difficult Women, are honest and raw and a little scary. This is the world we live in.\nAnd it can be a little hard to read. Gay doesn\u2019t hold back on some of the more difficult aspects of being a woman in this society, a fact hammered home by the collection\u2019s title, which itself nods to the \u201cdifficult woman\u201d stereotype. But Gay turns the idea on its ear by making sure these women, all of whom come off as real people, are difficult in some way or another, in addition to being women.",

Police claim Frein, a survivalist and suspected cop killer who has been on the run for more than two months, made the chilling comments to an acquaintance.

Authorities have been searching for Frein, 31, who is suspected of killing a state trooper and wounding another during an ambush in September. Frein\u2019s defense attorneys declined to comment on the remarks. After the comments were released, a law enforcement official told The Times that they indicated Frein knew the danger he was in and the consequences of his actions. Frein, who may face the death penalty if he is convicted, also told a friend that he wasn\u2019t going to be taken alive, according to the Times. Read more.\n\n{Andrew Joseph/Graham Media Group}",

They told me all the time.\n\nI've been called it all: pussy, faggot, bitch. I was called the n-word so many times I lost count.

I told Joel that he shouldn\u2019t be.

Like most issues of race in America, the real problem has been turned upside down. Rather than whites perpetrating their racism against blacks, the real problem has become that of black bigots.\nAnd we, as black leaders, are ignoring it",

Managers report to their department head who in turn reports to the CEO.\nThe department head has a set number of KPIs that they must hit each and every month.

Tyson spent more time in prison than he did winning boxing competitions. With a record 50 wins (including 44 by knockout), Tyson's ability to punch people in the face is unmatched.

We'd dare each other to throw stones at them as they tottered past in their funny hats and stockings and suspenders.\n\nWe'd sit at the bus stop, waiting patiently for the 207, and we'd watch them walk past in their crocodile, picking their noses and spitting, and we'd laugh.\n\nWell, they may laugh now, but they won't be laughing when the gourmet food trucks of London pull into town. And then they'll be the ones begging for chips and gravy.\n\nHa! Bet they wish they'd studied at the local comprehensive now, eh? Well, too late for them. But it's never too late for us. So come on, my darlings, let's go",

In truth, ERC derives barely 3 percent of its revenues from defense work, according to Del J. Brosius, the company's president.\nThe Pentagon said ERC would build electronic training systems for the Army and the Marines.\nThe total could grow to $174 million, depending on options.\n\"We can do it for a lot less money, but we're not going to complain,\" Brosius said Friday.\nERC, which has 150 employees, was one of 13 companies invited to bid after the Pentagon removed the competition last month, saying an \"urgent need\" existed for the equipment. But when ERC went public with its $110 million contract March 22, competitors cried foul and charged politics trumped sound business practice.\nRep. Henry W",

It is bigoted, racist, sexist, and otherwise morally abhorrent in all possible ways, and is never acceptable to say and even worse to write in the manner of a \u201cjoke\u201d. The sentence is a classic example of what bigots and racists want to have perceived as \u201cjust a joke\u201d.\nHowever, the mere fact that it is intended as a joke hardly cleanses it from the filth that it is. In order to understand this, it is important to first understand the nature of joking in general. Simply put, humour and joking are a natural part of human social interaction. The intent of humour is to take a situation or concept slightly outside of its normal context in order to comment upon or criticize it. Humour serves to break down social barriers by rendering serious subjects less threatening, and also serves to unify individuals within a group who share common values and understanding of humour.\nJoking can take two general forms, either satirical or banterous. Satirical jokes, such as political cartoons or humourous parodies of religious practices, are created in order to make a statement or highlight an issue of concern. Banterous jokes, in contrast, make no statement or attempt to communicate a specific issue, but are created merely for the sake of amusement and have no bearing beyond",

Many of us have been raised in an environment where everything is expected to be perfect by our parents, be it our career choices or life partner.\nThe desire of the parent not to let go of their child is akin to the love of the bird for its feathers, where the bird is willing to lose its feathers to ensure that the young one is well protected. Just as the bird is willing to lose feathers so too does the parent offer all that it has to provide for the well-being of the child. Yet as Larkin points out, despite the best efforts, there are times when things will go wrong and the fault often lies with the parents themselves.\nA study undertaken by The Telegraph suggests that, now-a-days, parents invest more and more time in shaping their child\u0092s lives and future than ever before. There are many books and programs that assure the parent that following their approach will ensure the child is successful in his school exams. The parent follows this advice to the letter, often ignoring the interests and wishes of their child for the sake of securing academic or professional success.\nLewis Carroll\u0092s \u0091Alice\u0092 is an example of a girl who is constantly trying to please her parents and society",

He throws his all into his 3-minute-long pop songs, cramming them full of hooks, harmonies and his signature powerhouse vocals. For years Mitch was the frontman for the band Bittersweet, with whom he released 2 albums on Universal. But as 2011 began, Mitch decided to get back to basics. So he wrote and recorded an album of power-pop all by his lonesome self in his home studio.\nThat album is I've Been Better, Mitch Radar's first album since 2002's The Last Great Hope.

The white hoods, black combat boots, and torches held aloft will certainly find their place in the canon of historical anti-American iconography. The violence in Charlottesville was carried out by a group that is unapologetically white supremacist and Nazi. They believe in something much bigger than themselves and are willing to die for that ideology.\n\nAnd it was all televised.\n\nThe news coverage was inescapable; even watching American Ninja Warrior, I saw a video montage of the events of this past weekend. And the more I saw, the more I heard these two chants: \u201cBlood and soil!\u201d chanted the white supremacists; \u201cNo fascist USA!\u201d chanted the counter-protesters. The words of the counter-protesters caught my attention. For years, I have struggled with how to explain my complicated feelings about living in a \u201cfree\u201d country that was founded on so much hate and wrongdoing. How to live with the tension of being grateful for where I am today while acknowledging that I wouldn\u2019t be here if not for the historical context that allowed",
