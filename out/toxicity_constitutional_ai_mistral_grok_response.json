The collective was led by Jim Dine and Claes Oldenburg, and was a part of the Neo-Dada movement that rejected traditional art in favor of more unconventional, rebellious forms. They would stage happenings, a new art form that often utilized performance and experimentation in order to challenge the audience and promote social change. Up Against the Wall Motherfucker was a pivotal part of the New York art scene, and helped to pave the way for future underground art movements like the Fluxus and the Happenings. This print features the group's iconic insignia with Jim Dine and Claes Oldenburg.",

Now Wayne wants a court to force the state attorney general's office to release all the videos from the event so he can prove that the question's wording was manipulated, according to court papers. A Missouri judge set Oct 4 for the first stage of Wayne's attempt to wrest records from the state AG, which he accuses of misrepresenting his message and mangling his public image in the wake of a 2009 drug arrest. Wayne's lawyer, Brian Lauten, filed a motion Monday with the Circuit Court judge handling the rapper's lawsuit against the AG. The judge's order says Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office has until Friday to produce the records Wayne and his attorney have requested that were taken during the March 2009 stop at St. Louis' Peabody Opera House to kick off an anti-drug campaign. Wayne is calling the videos he requested that show him discussing drugs with the teens, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports, adding that Wayne said he never said the quote widely attributed to him by Koster. \"I told you I never said it once.

The movie is a star-studded tribute to the cinema of martial arts, which Tarantino has professed his love for his entire career.\nTarantino is a student of the cinema of martial arts and a huge fan of its greatest practitioner, Bruce Lee (Enter the Dragon, Fist of Fury). So he came up with the idea for a movie that mashed up Lee (played by Mike Moh) and a variety of other martial arts stars and legends both real and imagined. The movie, which follows Moh\u2019s Ash Brantigan, an up-and-coming actor who has landed a starring role in the 1973 kung-fu film Enter the Dragon opposite Bruce Lee, is Tarantino\u2019s love letter to action, martial arts, and martial arts cinema.\nJackson plays the role of Hala, a martial arts actress as famous as Lee who is still struggling to find a role worthy of her skills.\nJackson was not in Shanghai for the press conference, and her absence drew some puzzlement from",

The only reason this should be taught in school is to see how wrong everyone was when they got involved with the whole movement but it isn't. We do it to help save out environment. The only reason is to get more money out of other peoples wallets and to get the population dependent on others for their livelihood. The only reason the electric cars were put into use was to make money off unsuspecting people who can't tell the difference between a fuel burning vehicle and a electric one. So people, take my advice and don't waste your money on a electric car. In a word, the only thing an electric car uses that a gas car does not use is some magical power source that was created when we burned the brains of some very, very smart men.

Betraying the expectations set by both Doom and Doom 3, there will actually be a new Doom.\nThe original Doom set the standard for first person shooters and Doom 3 was a disappointment simply because people thought it would be better than it was. The original Doom still holds a special place in our collective imagination, making the new Doom one of those games everyone is rooting for to succeed so that it can go on to become a franchise again.\nHence, this should be considered a mixed blessing. On one hand, you've got an original game designed by some very original minds. On the other hand, John Romero is the reason why the original minds are working on this new Doom, so that's gotta be a liability. It's like if someone asked you to build a new house for them",

FOAAS is part of the Push the Web Forward project, which focuses on promoting and standardizing an approach to API development that avoids some of the less robust habits we've picked up over the years.\nTheir API uses Status Code Indication, which provides error response codes in an easy-to-read format for errors like user does not exist, bad input, and outages. This helps both humans and machines to easily see the status of their requests (200 responses will show the response payload like any other request; error responses provide the error code and message, all on the same response).\nIn the process of building the API, we realized that we weren't sure what error response status codes most people would expect to see, so we built a quick survey with some of the most common API error codes. Our goals were to a) see where the expectations for error responses lie, and b) see if folks would be more likely to adopt Status Code Indication if it matched commonly expected status codes.\nFOAAS uses error codes that are inspired by status codes that are commonly used in other APIs (like GitHub and GitLab), but they are not identical. The idea is that they are familiar, but a little more descriptive. FOAAS also documents",

Dotson faces up to 12 years in prison and will be sentenced at an April 4 hearing. Dotson will have the option of having the judge impose the sentence or face the sentencing range in a jury trial.\nStiver is recovering from multiple bullet wounds in his left hand and arm.\nProsecutors told jurors Dotson was angry at Stiver, her on-and-off again boyfriend of several years, and that she was frustrated about his financial and employment woes. Dotson confronted Stiver in his driveway and demanded he pull over to talk. When Stiver hesitated, Dotson told him she had a knife, prosecutors said.\nStiver said he looked back and saw Dotson holding a handgun, so he put the car in reverse and tried to speed away, prosecutors said. She followed Stiver's van, firing at him",

The first is the ability of the system to deliver the necessary resources in terms of skills, information and support. The second is the personal qualities of the individual in terms of having a high sense of resilience, goal orientation and a positive mindset.\nAs the job gets less stable, less routine and less predictable so the skills an employee needs have to change. Instead of relying on experience and accumulated know-how, you must keep learning, constantly look out for new ideas and innovate.\nWe all like to be in groups, even if you feel at odds with them as a social animal you have a need to be a part of something. One of the best motivators for improving one\u2019s sense of resilience and wellbeing is learning new things from the people and situation around you.\nWork is one of the most socially-rich elements of daily life. There are many factors which determine how successful you are in your work: competence at the work, skill in negotiation, the ability to learn new things, and the ability to engage with people. Successful people usually exhibit a drive to improve themselves in all of these areas.\nThe ability to learn new things isn\u2019t just about keeping up with technological developments, it",

The term Waste Land is a translation of the Old English word for England, referring particularly to the flatlands of eastern England.\nThe poem describes the effect upon the speaker of his parents\u0092 experiences during the war, particularly his mother\u0092s. This can be related to the general impact upon women in the war \u0096 women who stayed in the UK and, like the speaker\u0092s mother, were left to get on with everyday life without their husbands.\nThe poem moves by abrupt changes of perspective \u0096 the child sees people as distorted and grotesque, as when his mother looks \u0093like a squashed Catholic\u0092s idea of the Virgin\u0094 \u0096 before moving into more objective descriptions of people\u0092s physical deformities, the products of the war\u0092s violence.\nEliot himself had not been in the war but his experiences during and after it",

The idea of a small, vulnerable, and empathetic preteen girl getting her own starring vehicle seemed to be repugnant to some people. In an attempt to reconcile the two opposing takes -- that a film starring Logan as the titular character would be a \"grim, violent R-rated flick\" and that the next X-Men movie would feature a preteen girl getting her claws wet -- fan speculation turned towards the idea of X-23 popping up in a supporting role in a Wolverine movie. I made the case as to how it was a good idea to have X-23 pop up in Wolverine 3 in this very piece, but, as with pretty much everything, fan opinion split. Some liked my argument, others, well, didn't. However, now that the film is in pre-production -- according to the same report that tipped us off about Mangold'",

Domestic terrorism is just another example of a country that doesn\u2019t prioritize its minority demographic. These are not the only hate crimes committed in recent years but just a few examples. In October 2018, 11 Jews were killed at the Pittsburgh synagogue.\nIn the aftermath of these violent crimes we are left to wonder and hope that politicians will push for gun control, but we have seen time and time again that politicians fail to pass meaningful legislation. It is clear that these crimes were committed by individuals driven by hate but it also clear that our politicians have let us down by failing to pass meaningful gun legislation. These mass shootings are preventable and they are a direct result of politicians\u2019 failure to keep their constituents safe..\nWhy do politicians fail to pass meaningful legislation after mass shootings?",

I\u2019m sure a lot of men will disagree with you and I think there was plenty of room to give Paris a hard time without going after her physically. I wouldn\u2019t call her \u201cugly\u201d as she is actually quite attractive physically. That is until her plastic surgery, which ruined her natural beauty. Paris has had enough experience with cameras that her posing is pretty natural for her. I have no problem with going after her for the stupid things she says, she is an easy mark because she is such a buffoon, but the plastic surgery comments are lame, and the \u201cugly\u201d comments are a bit much. She is pretty, just plain, and pretty stupid, which are not the same thing. There are a lot of beautiful people in the US that I don\u2019t find attractive at all because they have such empty minds. Paris Hilton isn\u2019t ugly. But she isn\u2019t \u201cpretty\u201d either. The media tends to think very highly of her looks, but to me, she looks like a poor man\u2019s Shannon Tweed. It has been my experience that anyone who takes a lot of photos with a professional photographer will develop an ability to pose that most of us are not attuned to.
